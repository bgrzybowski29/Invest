#### MVP
* User can enter a stock ticker
* 5 apis will be called
* Quote and image will be displayed and can link to additional info
* User clicks more info and new, company info and financials are displayed.   

#### POST MVP
* Styled the image and company card with a transform to rotate 30Â° by default and rotating back on hover. This make the card and image move when hovered over.
* Added a filtered autocomplete text search for company name. This allowas the user to quickly find the company and does not require them to know the stock symbol.
* Added a parallax help page.
* Added a full page overlay to display Co details, dividends, contact info and news. 
* Added local storage for the initial list of companies. This was making an api call and returning 10K companies each time the app loaded. I changed this to use local storage to cache the list.

#### Functional Components

###Issues and Resolutions
* Changing style of elements at runtime. I first used the dom to manipulate the style and ran into issues. I got it to work, but it was bad design. I ended up creating a style object and used conditional rendering.
* Issue retrieve from local storage.  I was doing a check if the object in local storage was 'undefined', but did not use the "typeof".
